    <p>A hamburger (or burger for short) is a food, typically considered a sandwich, consisting of one or more cooked
        patties—usually ground meat, typically beef—placed inside a sliced bread roll or bun. The patty may be pan
        fried, grilled, smoked or flame broiled. Hamburgers are often served with cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion,
        pickles, bacon, or chilis; condiments such as ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise, relish, or a "special sauce", often
        a variation of Thousand Island dressing; and are frequently placed on sesame seed buns. A hamburger topped with
        cheese is called a cheeseburger.</p>
